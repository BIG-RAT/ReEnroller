Use ReEnroller to build a package to take a macOS device enrolled in one Jamf server and enroll it into another.
* Ability to add (and then remove) a profile to the package.  This can help maintain a WiFi connection while migrating.
* Machine attempts to fail back to original server if enrollment in the new server fails.
* Specify the number of attempts and interval between attempts for enrolling in the new server.
* Can also be used for initial enrollments.
* Enroll into a specific site.
* Can automatically create a policy to verify enrollment in the new server.
* Select a policy to run after a successful enrollment.
* Deploy the package with policy or push it to an individual machine from within the app.

Important: After enrolling in the new server the user must approve the MDM profile for macOS 10.13 and above.<p>
<strong>Very Important:</strong> The package generated by the ReEnroller app will not run properly on machines where the ReEnroller app is present, either on local storage or a mounted drive.

**Be sure to view the help for detailed usage instructions.

Thanks @fauxserve for coming up with the idea and initial bash version.

## History
- 19-11-14: Fixed issue that prevented the re-enrollment process from working if the ReEnroller app was on the machine prior to running the package.
